### <div align="center">Department Highest Salary</div>

> Table 

```text
Table: Employee
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| id           | int     |
| name         | varchar |
| salary       | int     |
| departmentId | int     |
+--------------+---------+
 
Table: Department
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
```

> Problem 

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
departmentId is a foreign key (reference columns) of the ID from the Department table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID, name, and salary of an employee. It also contains the ID of their department.
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table. It is guaranteed that department name is not NULL.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of a department and its name.
Write a solution to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments.
Return the result table in any order.

> Input Example

```text
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
| 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
Department table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |
+----+-------+
```

> SQL Query **Solution**

```sql
SELECT Department.name AS Department, Employee.name as Employee, salary FROM Employee
JOIN Department ON Employee.departmentId = Department.Id
WHERE (departmentId, salary) IN
(SELECT departmentId, MAX(salary) 
FROM Employee
GROUP BY departmentId);
```

> Output Example

```text
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
```

### <div align="center">Rank Scores</div>

> Table 

```text
Table: Scores
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| score       | decimal |
+-------------+---------+
```

> Problem 

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the score of a game. Score is a floating point value with two decimal places.
Write a solution to find the rank of the scores. The ranking should be calculated according to the following rules:
The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.
If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking.
After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no holes between ranks.
Return the result table ordered by score in descending order.

> Input Example

```text
Scores table:
+----+-------+
| id | score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
```

> SQL Query **Solution**

```sql
SELECT s1.Score, (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Score) FROM Scores s2 WHERE s2.Score >= s1.Score) AS 'Rank'
FROM Scores s1
ORDER BY s1.Score Desc
```

> Output Example

```text
+-------+------+
| score | rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+
```
